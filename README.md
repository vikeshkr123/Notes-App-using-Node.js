# Notes-App-using-Nodejs
This is a simple demonstration of working of a Notes app providing several functions like:
* Adding a new note to notes.json file if it doesnot exist in json file already to avoid duplication.
* Remove a note if note is present in notes.json file otherwise throwing error "Not Found".
* Read a note if found printing detail of that note and if not found simply throw error.
* List all the notes present in notes.json file.
